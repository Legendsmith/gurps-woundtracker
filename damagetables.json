    "A":"[1] Attacks that miss by 1 hits the torso instead.",
    "B":"[2] Only imp, pi, and tbb attacks can target the eye – and only from the front or sides. Injury over HP/10 blinds the eye. Otherwise, treat as skull (wounding modifer ×4)., but without the extra DR!",
    "C":"[3] The skull gets an extra DR 2. Wounding modifier is ×4. Knockdown rolls are at -10. Critical hits use the Critical Head Blow Table (B556). Exception: These special effects do not apply to tox damage.",
    "D":"[4] Jaw, cheeks, nose, ears, etc. If the target has an open-faced helmet, ignore its DR. Knockdown rolls are at -5. Critical hits use the Critical Head Blow Table (B556). Cor damage gets a ×1.5 wounding modifier, and if it inflicts a major wound, it also blinds one eye (both eyes on damage over full HP). Random attacks from behind hit the skull instead. On front hit, roll 1d. 1 means skull [3] hit if attack is imp, pi, tbb. Otherwise it’s a nose hit [15]. -1 to bleeding rolls when destroyed, or -2 when severed",
    "E":"[5] Limb. Reduce the wounding multiplier of large pi, huge pi and imp damage to ×1. Any major wound (loss of over 1/2 HP from one blow) cripples the limb. Damage beyond that threshold is lost. Roll 1d, on a 1 cut, imp, pi, tbb hit vein/artery,see [17]. Cr hits a joint [15]. When dismembered, gives -3 to bleeding rolls, every 30s, or -4 if severed.",
    "F":"[6] If holding a shield, double the penalty to hit: -4 for shield arm, -8 for shield hand.",
    "G":"[7] Human males/males of similar species suffer double shock from cr damage, and get -5 to knockdown rolls. Otherwise, treat as a torso hit.",
    "H":"[8] Extremity. Treat as a limb, except that damage over 1/3 HP in one blow inﬂicts a crippling major wound. Excess damage is still lost. Roll 1d, on a 1 with cr, cut, pi, tbb hits a joint [14]. When dismembered, gives -2 to bleeding rolls, -3 if severed.",
    "I":"[9] If rolling randomly, roll 1d: 1-3 is right, 4-6 is left.",
    "J":"[10] Neck and throat. Increase the wounding multiplier of cr and corrosion attacks to ×1.5, and that of cutting damage to ×2. At the GM’s option, anyone killed by a cutting blow to the neck is decapitated! Roll 1d, on a 1 with cut, imp, pi, tbb hits vein/artery [17], if cr from behind, counts as [16] and gives Quadriplegic. Automatic if dmg > HP from Neck Snap or throw from Head Lock. Bleeding rolls are at -2, every 30s.",
    "K":"[11] Heart, lungs, kidneys, etc. Increase wounding modifier for imp or pi attack to ×3. Increase wounding modifer for tbb attack to ×2. cr is only ×1, if caused shock roll vs. knockdown, -5 if major wound, other attacks cannot target the vitals. When wounded, make bleeding rolls every 30s, at -4.",
    "L":"[12] Ear (-7): A fighter who can attack his foe’s face or skull can specifically target an ear instead. Treat this as a face hit except when making a cutting attack specifically to slice off the ear. In that case, injury over HP/4 is lost but has no special effect . . . but twice this amount removes the ear. This is a major wound, but without the -5 to knockdown rolls for a face hit. Missing ears (one or both) permanently reduce Appearance by a level. A miss by 1 hits the torso. To use a cupped hand to concuss the ear and cause deafness, see Ear Clap (p. 70). -1 to bleeding rolls when severed",
    "M":"[13] Jaw, if attacked with crushing, gives an extra -1 to knockdown",
    "N":"[14] Joints, limb crippled at HP/3, extremity at HP/4, HT roll to recover from crippling -2, miss by 1 hits the limb or extremity rather than the joint",
    "O":"[15] Nose, only targetable from the front, treat like face hit, HP/4 breaks nose gives major wound and no Sense of Smell/Taste until healed. Cut lops off nose if HP/4×2 (major wound) but knockdown not at -5 for face. Cutting off nose gives Appearance -2, and -1 to bleeding rolls at the time.",
    "P":"[16] Spine, only targetable from behind with cr, cut, imp, pi, or tbb. DR3, if shock-penalty roll against knockdown, crippled if dmg = HP which causes automatic knockdown and stunning",
    "Q":"[17] Veins and Arteries, only targetable by cut, imp, pi, or tbb. Increases wounding modifier plus 0.5, no crippling and no dmg limit, an attack that misses by 1 hits the neck, arm or leg, as appropriate",
    "R":"[18] Roll 1d on  a cr, imp, pi or tbb attack. On 1, hit to the vitals [11], cut from behind hits the spine [16]",
    "S":"[19] Roll 1d on a cr, imp, pi or tbb attack. On 1, hit to the vitals [11], cut from behind hits the spine [16]. But if major wound you fall down. Until healed you're Lame(Missing Leg) and can’t stand so you must fight sitting or lying. Armour for torso and groin or specific protects normally",
